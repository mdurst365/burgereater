# :hamburger: Burger Eater :hamburger:

Burger eater is a Node.JS app that works with a MySQL database to create a fictional resturant. When users visit the resturant, they may input the names of burgers they would like to create, see the list of created burgers, eat the burgers they just ordered and then throw away the wrappers.

It was developed using the MVC architectural pattern and the user interactions designed to demonstrate CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.
